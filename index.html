            <P>We live in Germany and
            also operate our server infrastructure via reliable cloud providers
            based in Germany. Our structure is secure and redundant and is
            secured by regular backups. Technical upgrades of the Cardano
            Foundation are regularly and promptly installed after release, the
            downtime of our servers is only a few seconds.</P>

            <P>We are not IT
            professionals, but technology and IT nerds with an engineering
            background in environmental protection and as activists in the
            Climate Protection Movement (FFF). We are committed and idealistic in
            our efforts to contribute to the Cardano project and at the same time
            to connect with the ideals for an ecological, sustainable future for
            our planet.</P>

            <P>We
            support the Cardano open source cryptocurrency project and the
            decentralisation of the block chain through our stake pool. For more
            information about Cardano and its great potential for the renewal and
            democratisation of the global financial system, please visit <A HREF="https://cardano.org/">this
            site. </A>
            </P>
            
            <P>At the same time, we
            have the ambition to support the global climate protection movement.
            Bitcoin must have no future prospects if the energy required for
            financial transactions through Bitcoin currently accounts for around
            10% of the energy requirements of the industrialised nation of
            Germany.</P>

            <ol>   
                <LI>
                    <P>We rely on Cardano's
                Proof of Stake (PoS) concept, which, in contrast to the Proof of
                Work (PoW) concept of Bitcoin and other crypto currencies, requires
                only a fraction of the energy. </FONT>

                <LI>
                    <P>We use renewable
                energy for the operation of our server infrastructure. Thus our
                contribution to the stability of the network is 100% CO2 neutral.</P>

                <LI>
                    <P>We
                donate half the fee of our stake pool (currently 1.95% of the rewards)
                to climate protection initiatives. Since we assume that the
                ADA exchange rate (crypto currency of the Cardano project) will rise
                sharply in the coming months and years, we are initially setting up
                a reserve/provision which will be delegated back to the pool and
                will continue to increase via compound interest effects. The cut-off
                date for accounting and subsequent distribution is 31.12. of each
                year. The results will be announced on <A HREF="https://twitter.com/Co2Pool">Twitter</A>
                and this
                website.</P>
                
                <LI>
                    <P>Our
                followers on Twitter decide which climate protection initiative we
                support. We will put a selection to the vote, but will also take
                into account suggestions from the community.<A HREF="mailto:co2poolada@gmail.com"> Please

            <P>The
            more delegates and active stake our pool has, the more likely it is
            that our pool will produce blocks and receive a reward. Here you can
            find more information about <A HREF="https://www.adatainment.com/index.php?page=staking_pool&amp;lang=en">staking</A>
            and
            <A HREF="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/cardano/calculate">rewards</A>.
            </P>
            
            <P>98.5%
            of this reward goes to you - our delegates. The reward will be
            distributed to the delegates after deduction of the pool's operating
            costs and the 1.5% share for climate protection, in proportion to
            their contribution. On an annual average, an &quot;interest income&quot;of
            ~5% can be expected - where else can you find something like that?
            And this is completely risk-free - your ADAs remain in your full
            possession on your wallet. Please NEVER send ADAs directly to a
            wallet address when staking! Serious pools will never ask you to do
            so. Secure wallets like <A HREF="https://daedaluswallet.io/">Daedalus</A> have
            a function to delegate your stake to the pool of your choice -
            hopefully you will choose <A HREF="https://adapools.org/pool/11cad31f95526b86724c84b818228fc2500bca5ce9b2864a85b94058">[CO2P]</A>.

            <P>Please
            note that we can only be successful with your support. We are not
            financial investors with large financial reserves, but technology
            freaks, environmentalists and activists. Our pool has already proven
            its function with the production of blocks. To statistically produce
            one block per epoch of 5 days (this is a prerequisite for the
            rewards) we need a stake sum of 2 -3 million ADA for our pool. Some
            large pools currently have around 100 - 200 million ADA - time to
            support the smaller pools. Among them there are other pools that are
            also socially, politically or environmentally motivated, e.g.

            <P>We only provide the
            infrastructure of our StakePool and support the Cardano project, but
            explicitly do not give any recommendations on financial issues. It is
            up to each individual to decide whether or not an investment in ADA
            makes sense and, if so, what risks are involved. Any investment in
            financial products involves risks, in particular price fluctuations,
            which can occur at any time, both in stock market prices and in
            crypto currencies. We expressly assume no liability for your profits
            or losses.
            </P>
            
            <P>You can also inform
            yourself about all relevant tax issues and, if necessary, obtain
            information from your local tax office.
