note that we can only be successful with your support. We are not

its function with the production of blocks. To statistically produce
one block per epoch of 5 days (this is a prerequisite for the
rewards) we need a stake sum of 2 -3 million ADA for our pool. Some
large pools currently have around 100 - 200 million ADA - time to
support the smaller pools. Among them there are other pools that are
also socially, politically or environmentally motivated, e.g. </SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US"><SPAN STYLE="background: #ffff00">xx</SPAN></SPAN><SPAN LANG="en-US">,
